# MediaPlayerInfo

This is a Kotlin wrapper around platform-specific APIs to read the currently playing media.

The original idea came from [this](https://github.com/Redstonecrafter0/WindowsReadMediaInfo) PoC.

## Compiling
In order to compile the native library you need the MSVC compiler and the Windows SDK.
