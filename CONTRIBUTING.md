Sure, here's a basic template for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. You can modify it to suit your project's specific needs.

# Contributing to MediaPlayerInfo

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MediaPlayerInfo. It's people like you that make MediaPlayerInfo such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/Redstonecrafter0/MediaPlayerInfo/issues) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/Redstonecrafter0/MediaPlayerInfo/issues/new)!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork MediaPlayerInfo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localisation
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Get the code

The first thing you'll need to do is get the code. Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository.

Then, clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MediaPlayerInfo.git
```

## Make a pull request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with MediaPlayerInfo's master branch:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Redstonecrafter0/MediaPlayerInfo.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```bash
git checkout 325-add-japanese-localisation
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 325-add-japanese-localisation
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) :D

## Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of [good](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) [resources](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) but here's the suggested workflow:

```bash
git checkout 325-add-japanese-localisation
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease 325-add-japanese-localisation
```

## Thank you for contributing!

We're really excited that you're interested in helping us!
